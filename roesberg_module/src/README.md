# Custom Resolver Business Logic Implementation

This folder is meant to contain the custom business logic or API/database interfaces for the application.

This is where you can add your own custom logic as modules, which can then be imported into the `resolvers.js` file in the parent directory and referenced by the `resolvers` object.
